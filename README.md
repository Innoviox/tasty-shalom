# tasty-shalom
The source code for the website tasty-shalom.tk


Note: the tasty-template.html page is actually a .twig file because the hosting service I am using likes .twig extensions. But I can't open .twig extensions on my computer so I call it a .html.


So open the tasty-template-htmlified.html page.
